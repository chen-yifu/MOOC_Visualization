	abstract = {Early screening for colon cancer (CC) allows for early stage diagnosis of the malignancy and potentially reduces disease mortality as the cancer is most likely curable at its earliest stages. Early detection would be desirable if accurate, practical and cost-effective diagnostic measures for this cancer were available. Mortality and morbidity from CC represent a major health problem involving a malignant disease that is theoretically preventable through screening. Current screening methods (e.g., the convenient and inexpensive immunological fecal occult blood test, FOBTi, obtained from patients' medical records) either lack sensitivity and require dietary restriction, which impedes compliance and use; are costly (e.g., colonoscopy), which decreases compliance; or could result in mortality. In comparison with the FOBT test, a non-invasive sensitive screen for which there is no requirement for dietary restriction would be a more convenient test. Colorectal cancer is the only cancer for which colonoscopy is recommended as a screening method. Although colonoscopy is a reliable screening tool, the invasive nature, abdominal pain, potential complications and high cost have hampered the application of this procedure worldwide. A screening approach using the stable miRNA molecules, which are relatively non-degradable when extracted from non-invasive stool and semi-invasive blood samples by commercially available kits and manipulated thereafter, would be preferable to a transcriptomic mRNA-, a mutation DNA-, an epigenetic- or a proteomic-based test. The approach uses reverse transcriptase, modified real-time quantitative PCR. Although exosomal RNA would be missed, using a restricted extraction of total RNA from stool or blood, a parallel test could also be carried out on RNA obtained from stool or plasma samples, and appropriate corrections for exsosomal loss can be made for accurate and quantitative test result. Eventually, a chip can be developed to facilitate diagnosis, as has been done for the quantification of genetically modified organisms in foods. The gold standard to which the molecular miRNA test is compared is colonoscopy, which can be obtained from patients' medical records. If performance criteria are met, as detailed herein, a miRNA test in human stool or blood samples based on high-throughput automated technologies and quantitative expression measurements commonly used in the diagnostic clinical laboratory should be advanced to the clinical setting, which will make a significant impact on CC prevention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medical natural language processing (NLP) systems have been developed to identify, extract and encode information within clinical narrative text. However, the role of NLP in clinical research and patient care remains limited. Pancreatic cysts are common. Some pancreatic cysts, such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), have malignant potential and require extended periods of surveillance. We seek to develop a novel NLP system that could be applied in our clinical network to develop a functional registry of IPMN patients.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to validate the accuracy of our novel NLP system in the identification of surgical patients with pathologically confirmed IPMN in comparison with our pre-existing manually created surgical database (standard reference).
METHODS: The Regenstrief EXtraction Tool (REX) was used to extract pancreatic cyst patient data from medical text files from Indiana University Health. The system was assessed periodically by direct sampling and review of medical records. Results were compared with the standard reference.
RESULTS: Natural language processing detected 5694 unique patients with pancreas cysts, in 215 of whom surgical pathology had confirmed IPMN. The NLP software identified all but seven patients present in the surgical database and identified an additional 37 IPMN patients not previously included in the surgical database. Using the standard reference, the sensitivity of the NLP program was 97.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 94.8-98.9\%) and its positive predictive value was 95.5\% (95\% CI 92.3-97.5\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Natural language processing is a reliable and accurate method for identifying selected patient cohorts and may facilitate the identification and follow-up of patients with IPMN.},
