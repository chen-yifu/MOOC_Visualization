# MOOC_Visualization
An interactive visualization for MOOC certifications

This visualization uses JavaSript D3 to make the nodes repel eachother and behave dynamically.

To adapt it to your own certificates, replace the data in `mooc_certifications.json`, and change the following line of code:

`d3.json("your_link.json", function(json) {...}`
